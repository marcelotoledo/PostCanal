Hello Marcelo.

It turns out that Tumblr is much easier than LiveJournal. I finished it in a few hours. I setup a proxy software on my own computer and I can connect to all of the web sites all around the world now! I am such a genius. LOL.

The source code is very similar to LiveJournal, because you said that LiveJournal's code is just what you want. I attached the source code, it is a draft one, I can do any modification according to your comments in the future.

How to do the test: the blog url is http://peter4test.tumblr.com/, the user name is mituzhishi@gmail.com (tumblr use emails address as username), the password is peter2win. I have done serval tests, it works pretty well, and it supports utf-8.

It is neither a complete one nor a tested one. instead it is just a quich draft one. If you find any problems, please feel free to tell me. Customer is God.


Best Regards,
Peter
